**A Hybrid Storytelling Language for Authors, Creators, Game Writers, and AI Tools**

Ludus is a narrative-focused, hybrid scripting language designed for:

- **Authors and storytellers** who want to build branching, emotionally rich stories  
- **Content creators** designing frameworks for interactive books, podcasts, or blogs  
- **Game developers** building dialogue systems and branching plots  
- **Screenwriters and playwrights** who want to prototype story structures  
- **AI enthusiasts** integrating large language models (LLMs) like GPT or Gemini to expand narrations  
- **Python and JavaScript developers** who want to parse and manipulate stories programmatically

 Supports structured yet human-readable story writing  
 Exports to JSON for data-driven tools or visualization  
Plays well with LLMs to turn narrate sections into rich prose
